# ROS2 Navigation Stack
ROS 2-based navigation system with mapping, path planning, and path following nodes.
A user can set a goal position, and the robot will autonomously navigate to it while avoiding obstacles along the way.


## ‚ú® Features
- **Mapping** ‚Äì Generates a map of the environment using onboard sensors.
- **Path Planning** ‚Äì Calculates an optimal path from the robot‚Äôs current position to the goal **using the A\* algorithm** on a **costmap**.
- **Path Following** ‚Äì Executes the planned path, dynamically avoiding obstacles, with **emergency stop** if a new obstacle appears directly in front of the robot.
- Supports **goal input via RViz** or custom interfaces.

## üñº Example Output
The path planning module uses **A\*** on a **costmap** to compute an optimal route to the goal.  
- **Black line** ‚Äì Path computed by the A\* algorithm.  
- **Red line** ‚Äì Interpolated path for smoother following.

The following plot compares the **desired** and **measured** robot orientation during path following, as well as the tracking error.
