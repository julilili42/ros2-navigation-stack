# ROS2 Navigation Stack
ROS 2-based navigation system with mapping, path planning, and path following nodes.
A user can set a goal position, and the robot will autonomously navigate to it while avoiding obstacles along the way.


## ‚ú® Features
- **Mapping** ‚Äì Generates a map of the environment using onboard sensors.
- **Path Planning** ‚Äì Calculates an optimal path from the robot‚Äôs current position to the goal.
- **Path Following** ‚Äì Executes the planned path, dynamically avoiding obstacles.
- Supports **goal input via RViz** or custom interfaces.


## üì¶ Requirements
- ROS 2
- `nav_msgs`, `geometry_msgs`, `sensor_msgs`, `tf2_ros`
- A robot setup with odometry and sensor data (e.g., LiDAR)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Start mapping
```bash
ros2 launch mapping mapping.launch.py  
```

### Start path_planning
```bash
ros2 run path_planning path_planning.launch.py
```

### Start path_following
```bash
ros2 launch path_following path_following.launch.py 
```
